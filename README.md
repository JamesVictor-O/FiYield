## Problem

DeFi has $100B+ locked in protocols, but:

Too complex ‚Üí 50 tabs of research, DeFiLlama charts, endless jargon.

Too risky ‚Üí Hacks and scams drained $3.7B in 2022 (Chainalysis).

Too exclusive ‚Üí Only crypto-native pros benefit, while the 99% (especially in Africa) are locked out, earning just 2% bank yields.

Too slow ‚Üí Manual yield chasing lags behind fast-moving opportunities.
